Recently the Australian government faced a challenge, when a radioactive capsule was lost during the transit and  the incident got detected later while recounting.

Similarly in transit of many high value Assets, there comes a challenge of preventing theft and an even bigger challenge arises when the theft or leakage happens but doesn’t get detected. For example, in college Exam papers, someone can take pics and put them back, thus theft is not detected. And there’s also a lack of accountability.


To overcome this challenge, 4 founders from iStart Incubation Center Jodhpur collaborated to solve, and as a brainchild a trust and transparency based solution is born, Asset Protection Leakage and intrusion handling system. (APLIHS)
